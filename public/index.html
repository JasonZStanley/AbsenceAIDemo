        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>This service will parse an audio clip and convert it into text. It will then attempt to extract the childs name, along with the reason and duration for absence</p>

        <p>The following Postman collection can be used to interact with the service: <a href="./demo.postman_collection.json" download>Postman Collection</a></p>

        <h1>Current limitations</h1>
        <p>This is a basic PoC.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A fairly basic transcription model is used as a decent GPU is required to run larger models in a timely fashion. A better model will have better accuracy</li>
            <li>What is being pulled out of the text can be improved and extended.</li>
            <li>Generally speaking, the code does enough to function but lacks error handling, ability to scale, validation etc etc</li>
        </ul>
